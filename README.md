# gfas

gfas (**G**itHub **F**ollowing **A**uto **S**ynchronization) manipulates your
GitHub following list to match your followers, enabling you to follow back
and unfollow back automatically. It runs on CLI and can be scheduled with
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions).

## Usage

### GitHub Actions

- Copy-paste the
  [Sync](.github/workflows/sync.yml)
  workflow to any of your repositories. You can just fork this repository for convenience.
- Create a
  [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
  with the `user:follow` permission.
- Create an
  [secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
  named `TOKEN` in the repository containing the token value.
- Customize your workflow, e.g. modify the [scheduled time](https://docs.github.com/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) (defaults to every 6 hours).
- Maybe you want to trigger it manually to see the effect.

### CLI

**[Archives of precompiled binaries for gfas are available for Windows,
macOS and Linux.](https://github.com/Resonaa/gfas/releases)** Linux and
Windows binaries are static executables. Users of platforms not explicitly
mentioned below are advised to download one of these archives.

If you're a **Rust programmer**, gfas can be installed with `cargo`.
Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for gfas is **1.75.0**,
although gfas may work with older versions.

```
$ cargo install gfas
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a gfas
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall gfas
```

After installation, run `gfas --help` for all commands and options.

### API

The
[gfas-api](https://crates.io/crates/gfas-api)
crate exports some
[GitHub API bindings](https://docs.rs/gfas-api)
which can be used to build your application.

```sh
$ cargo add gfas-api
```

```rust
use gfas_api::GitHub;

let github = GitHub::builder().token("<TOKEN>").endpoint("https://api.github.com").build()?;

github.follow("<USER-TO-FOLLOW>").await?;
```

## Building

gfas is written in Rust, so you'll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
gfas compiles with Rust 1.72.0 (stable) or newer. In general, gfas tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build gfas:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Resonaa/gfas
$ cd gfas
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/gfas help
```

### Running tests

gfas is relatively well-tested, including both unit tests and integration
tests. To run the full test suite, use:

```
$ cargo test
```

from the repository root.
